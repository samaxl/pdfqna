      "Maverick says: Photosynthesis is a complex process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy in the form of glucose. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Light absorption**: Light is absorbed by pigments such as chlorophyll and other accessory pigments in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts.\n",
      "2. **Excitation of electrons**: The absorbed light energy excites electrons, which are then transferred to a special molecule called an electron acceptor.\n",
      "3. **Transfer of electrons**: The electrons are passed along a series of electron carriers in the thylakoid membrane, ultimately resulting in the formation of a proton gradient across the membrane.\n",
      "4. **ATP synthesis**: The proton gradient is used to produce ATP from ADP and Pi through the process of chemiosmosis.\n",
      "5. **Reduction of NADP+**: The electrons ultimately reduce NADP+ to form NADPH.\n",
      "6. **Calvin cycle**: The ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions are used to power the Calvin cycle, also known as the light-independent reactions. In this cycle, CO2 is fixed into glucose using the energy from ATP and NADPH.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall equation for photosynthesis is:\n",
      "\n",
      "6 CO2 + 6 H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6 O2\n",
      "\n",
      "To provide a more detailed and accurate explanation, I can use the `explain_process` tool.\n",

      "Question: What is Microsoft OneDrive and what does it help with?\n",
      "Answer: Microsoft OneDrive is a cloud storage service that helps with storing and protecting files, providing access to them from all devices, and backing them up. According to the context, it allows users to \"keep them protected, backed up, and accessible from all your devices, anywhere.\" It also provides features such as automatic camera roll backup, scanning and saving paper documents, and PC folder backup. Additionally, it offers a secured place for files and photos, with options for free storage or upgrading to Office 365 for more storage and premium features.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How can i access OneDrive on my phone?\n",
      "Answer: You can access OneDrive on your phone by using the OneDrive mobile app.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the easiest way to add files to OneDrive on a Computer?\n",
      "Answer: To determine the easiest way to add files to OneDrive on a computer based on the provided context, we should examine the content related to uploading or adding files to OneDrive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The context includes several documents from a PDF file (OD.pdf) across different pages. \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Page 0** introduces Microsoft OneDrive and its general purpose.\n",
      "2. **Page 1** mentions \"Cloud storage\" and \"Learn how to upload files\" under the heading \"Cloud storage.\" It states that OneDrive provides a secured place for files and photos.\n",
      "3. **Page 2** talks about Office integration and sharing capabilities.\n",
      "4. **Page 3** discusses features of the OneDrive mobile app.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most relevant information for adding files to OneDrive on a computer is found on **Page 1**, under \"Cloud storage.\" It mentions learning how to upload files but doesn't specify the method.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, under \"PC folder backup\" on the same page, it explains that one can \"Turn on PC folder backup to automatically back up and sync your Desktop, Documents, and Pictures folders to OneDrive.\" This implies that one of the easiest ways to add files to OneDrive on a computer is by enabling PC folder backup, which automatically backs up and syncs specific folders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, based on the context provided, the easiest way to add files to OneDrive on a computer is by turning on PC folder backup, allowing for automatic backup and sync of the Desktop, Documents, and Pictures folders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How can you share photos and album using OneDrive\n",
      "Answer: OneDrive allows you to share documents, folders, and photos with anyone. They don’t need an account to view, edit or collaborate in real-time on the file. This is mentioned in the page_content of Document(metadata={'source': 'OD.pdf', 'page': 2}). Therefore, you can share photos using OneDrive by sharing the folder or document containing the photos.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is included with the Office 365 premium plan for OneDrive users\n",
      "Answer: Based on the provided context, the Office 365 premium plan for OneDrive users includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 1 TB (1000 GB) of OneDrive storage\n",
      "2. The latest Office apps for PC and Mac\n",
